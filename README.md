# PowerCom

PowerCom is a blockchain-based application that will fall under defi. Its purpose is to enable anyone to contribute towards a common project such as plantation farming, real estate, transportâ€”any project. 
The platform will work just like farming in defi. Example: Someone comes up with a solid idea with detailed layout that will attract potential investors. Investor here will be anyone with cryptocurrency holdings irregardless of age or amount of crypto they hold. Once a potential investor is interested in the project, they will lock an amount of crypto they wish to contribute towards the project in a smart contract. A code representing their stake towards the project will be generated and sent to them. 
Upon project completion, revenue generated due to the project income will be distributed to the investors' wallet addresses or ENS with respect to the profit redistribution model.

## Features

- Users can view the project's progress.
- Projects may be sub-dibided into phases,whereby contributers can choose to inject more funds if a certain phase of a project is completed to their satisfaction.
-Some projects may have to collaterize their first phase in order to secure investors' funds.
- Since it is a smart contract-based application,contributers may vote,based on the project's progress satisfaction, to let the remaining funds in the contribution pool be available for withdrawal by any willing member or remain in the contribution pool. The condition for the smart contract excecution here is the the pre-determined vote percentage.
-  Members will have a decentralized forum to discuss the project's progress. Only their ENS or wallet addresses will appear in the forum
- Members can vote in or vote out the project's leader anonymously.
